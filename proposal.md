# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Finals Frenzy

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A platformer game about fighting homework (similar to Mario but with different elements). 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will complete this project on Unity. My software will include different calculations for damage with weapons, powerups, and enemies. It will also include the code needed for movement and interactions with the environment. There will also be a final boss, which will be a more complex enemy with different attacks, each of which will need their own calculations and code to actually execute the movement.  


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

n/a

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

n/a

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will create the "level" with at least one type of smaller enemy, one type of weapon, a simple environment, and the final boss. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will create the level with multiple smaller enemies, two types of weapons, a simple environment, and the final boss.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I will create the level with multiple smaller enemies, multiple types of weapons, a complex and interactive environment, and the final boss. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to apply what I already know in C#. I will also need to research more conceptual topics, like how to make a game engaging and fun, as well as more specific tangible skills, like how to actually use Unity, how to make characters move, how to make sprites interact with each other, and how to actually implement sprites into the game. Additionally, I would like to create my own soundtrack, so that would require its own research as well.
