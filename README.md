Overall, I had a really tough time with time. It was definitely a lesson learned, I greately underestimated how many components there were to coding a game. My greatest challenge, as I mentionedin the video, was scaling my sprite. When I would try to use the movement, the sprite would shrink to its original 64x64 pixel size. The video that inspired my code was using the vector (1,1,1) to move their sprite, so it took be a bit but I eventually figured out that I could just add a factor that scales my sprite directly in the vector. 

My favorite trick that I learned was being able to add variables in VScode that then had a space to be changed directly in Unity. In the future, when I add more complex mechanics like damage to the game, I will definitely be using this feature to  easily test different values out. 

I also learned a lot about frustration and failure. I attempted to implement a jumping animation, but I could not figure it out. That's the first thing that I will fix, but even if I didn't fix it yet, I learned a lot about debugging and not giving up.
