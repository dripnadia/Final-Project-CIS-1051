Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have watched an in depth overview of C# in order to be able to understand what I am doing in Unity and understand the tutorials that will help me create my game. I have also learned how the setup of Unity works, and have created a VERY basic and simplified backround and character, and have started on movement.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not truly gotten into the coding of the game itself, and have not started designing sprites and figuring out a weapon system with damage etc in code. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

To be quite honest, I am much farther behind at this point than I would like to be. I had complications due to a family emergency; my grandma was in the hospital and passed away on Thursday of last week, so I was home from Tuesday night until Sunday night, which deeply cut into the time I had planned on spending on my project. However, I believe that I have set myself up with what I have done so far to be able to succeed with proper time management in the coming week. I look forward to building this project up!
