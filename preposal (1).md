# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I have three main ideas that have been on my mind for my final project! I am considering making a small game (maybe a visual novel type with RenPy), a mod for Stardew Valley (maybe one that replaces the weapons with Elden Ring weapons that have cool effects), or a website for my mom's art business. I am mostly leaning towards making a visual novel with minigames in RenPy, since I like to draw and I think I can tell a cool story using this platform. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

n/a

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Do you have any advice/ reccommendations for how to make music? I would want to do that if I do RenPy, but I have never explored making music digitally.
